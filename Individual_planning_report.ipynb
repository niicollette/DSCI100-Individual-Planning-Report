    "1. What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "2. We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "3. We are interested in demand forecasting, namely, what time windows are most likely to have large number of simultaneous players. This is because we need to ensure that the number of licenses on hand is sufficiently large to accommodate all parallel players with high probability."

    "#### 1. Data description\n",
    "- number of observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "sessions.csv = 1535 rows × 5 columns --> only start_time is important (and hashedEmail, but only for merging)\n",
    "\n",
    "players.csv = 196 rows x 9 columns --> only experience is important (and hashedEmail, but only for merging)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Provided dataset for player sessions has 1535 rows of observations and 5 variable columns. For sessions dataset, there is a categorical variable named \"hashedData\" that provides player identification (categorical) for each unique login seen in column \"start_time\" that provides day, month, year and exact hour (temporal). Out of the remaining columns, \"end_time\" represents the end of the session (temporal), while \"original_start_time\" and \"original_end_time\" most likely represent the exact second (since server has been opened) player has logged in and out. Provided dataset for player information has 196 rows of observations and 7 variable columns. For player dataset, there is the same categorical variable providing player ID names \"hashedData\" and associated experience level for each player labeled \"experience\" (also categorical). Dataset provides additonal categorical data; subscription status to newsletter, name, gender, and age. The only qualitative data is \"played_hours\". There are potential issues with player dataset, as experience level is self reported and could be inaccurate. Additionally, there is no further information provided for player activity beyond login information (e.g., is player contributing a significant amount of activity, requiring larger server capacity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- issues with the data:\n",
    "    - Experience is self reported and might not be accurate, no further information regarding activity of player (how active is the player being? is this much activity making the server run poorly? or are they not active at all? inflated login count but little activity, did not need to upgrade server to handle a lot of activity during certain period of time.\n",
    "#### 2. Question\n",
    "- what is the response variable of interest and one or more explanatory variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Response variable: when would player be the most active\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanatory variables: experience level\n",

    "The question of interest that will be answered is question 3, regarding demand forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can we predict when players are most likely to log on based on skill level?\n",
    "- describe how data will help address question of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset has player login time (start_time) and player skill level (experience), we can measure when players are most active and specifically what type of player is most active. The data can be categorized by experience, allowing us to see what percentage of players in each skill level are playing at a given time. This information can then be applied to anticipate peak player activity if there is a surge in a particular amount of players of a certain experience level.\n",
    "#### 3. Exploratory data analysis and visualization\n",
    "- data set loaded into python\n",
    "- wrangle data (minimum)\n",
    "- visualizations (include labels, titles, and units of measurement)\n",
    "- what insights do you gain from plots?\n",
    "  \n",
    "From plotted graphs, we can see a linear relationship from afternoon to evening and morning to afternoon for player logins.\n",
    "#### 4. Methods and plan\n",
    "To address the predictive question, a linear regression model will be performed. This method is appropriate because data shows a linear relationship between variables, making linear regression the better choice over K-Nearest Neighbors regression. After aggregating login information by hour of day/month, the data shows a linear trend (i.e., login number rises from afternoon to evening, and declines from morning to afternoon). Linear regression provides an easily interpretable equation, describing how login likelihood varies with skill level. For this method, we are assuming that the data is linear (e.g., login frequency as a positive or negative linear relationship with experience level and periods of time). A potential weakness of the model selected are that player login patterns might have unexpected peaks (e.g., login spike in the afternoon) that cannot by captured by linear regression. Additionally, there can be outliers that affect predictions (e.g., player logs in multiple times in the afternoon, disrupting the linearity of data from the afternoon to evening). To comapre and select the model, it will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric to show the differences between predicted data and actual data. Furthermore, we can compare linear regression with KNN regression to see which model has better predictions. To process the data and apply it to the model, we need to encode \"experience\" as a categorical variable and extract start_hour and start_month from start_time data. The data would be split 70%-30% into training and testing datasets after necessary variables have been wrangled."
